Here's a great beginner Rust project for you:

## **Personal Expense Tracker (CLI)**

**Project Goal:** Build a command-line application that helps track personal expenses.

**Core Features:**
- Add a new expense with description, amount, and category (food, transport, entertainment, etc.)
- List all expenses
- Calculate total spending
- Filter expenses by category
- Save/load data to a text file (using simple format like CSV or JSON)

**What You'll Learn:**
- Basic Rust syntax and ownership concepts
- Working with `struct` and `enum` types
- Using `Vec` for storing data
- Pattern matching with `match`
- File I/O operations
- Error handling with `Result`
- Parsing command-line arguments (you can use the `clap` crate or just `std::env::args()`)

**Example Usage:**
```
$ expense-tracker add --description "Lunch" --amount 12.50 --category food
$ expense-tracker list
$ expense-tracker total
$ expense-tracker filter --category food
```

This project is perfect because it's:
- Practical and useful
- Small enough to complete in a few days
- Covers fundamental Rust concepts
- Can be extended with more features as you learn (like date tracking, budgets, statistics)
